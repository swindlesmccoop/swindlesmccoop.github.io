<p>I bought a Kindle Paperwhite about a year ago...or maybe longer than that, but it was quite a good investment. I could read pretty much anything I wanted to. All I had to do was mount it as a normal drive and then cp any PDF or djvu files that I had over to its storage. Now this was all fine and good. It was a nice screen (not like the normal tablet ones with apps and whatnot, this was strictly for reading because it had no other functions) and I would read it at night or whenever I had some downtime and wanted to just read a book. However, I recently went ahead and picked up a Kindle Fire, the aforementioned tablet with apps, and it was the worst experience ever. I picked it up because it was around $15, a steal for the 7 HD, but I was shocked at how awful ti was from the standpoint of freedom. Of course, the first thing I tried to do was put a PDF on it. I had some .tex files of some books I wanted to read, so I compiled them into PDFs and dropped them onto the device, just like I did with my previous Kindle. Except when I went to open them, there was an issue – the PDFs were...DRM-protected? Now if you know anything about me, you would know that I’m pretty much Anti-DRM, which made this pretty crazy. I compile a PDF from a plain text file and it says there’s DRM on it when there is clearly none? I found this astonishing. And other people online had the same issue. I already knew about Calibre (eBook library management software) and had it installed, and apparently if you transfer a PDF from your computer to the Kindle using Calibre, it sends it in a way that allows you to read it. To be honest, I have no idea what it’s actually doing, but it Just Works<sup>TM</sup>. So that was all fine and good. I saw it pop up on the library on the Kindle, so I was glad. A bit annoyed that I had to use external software instead of the terminal, meaning I couldn’t write a script to do it, but how often was I going to transfer books to it when I planned on giving it away? I have my Paperwhite anyways. So I clicked on it. And you want to know what it said? Go ahead, guess.</p>
<p>Done guessing? I’m sure you couldn’t figure it out. Something along the lines of this: "You need to sign into your Amazon account in order to read this book." What? Why? It’s a PDF that I made. It’s mine. What the heck? Well I found a bit of an annoying exploit to get around it, but you can eventually read the book. You have to click on the book, then before the popup comes, go back, then click on the book again, wait for the popup, then hit "sign in," then hit back. I guess it fails to put you back on the popup or something because then...it just lets you read the book. I hate this thing.</p>
