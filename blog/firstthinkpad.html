<p>I finally got a ThinkPad! It was my birthday recently, and I got a refurbished T20s as a gift for that birthday. I <a href="/blog/artixmanually.html">immediately installed Artix onto it</a> and I’ve been having a great time ever since. I think this is a good opportunity for me to learn how to use a tiling WM and stuff, but let’s save that for later. After all, most of the work that I do is from the terminal anyways.</p>
