<p>I started my website about two years ago now. It originally was on the <a href="https://cbps.xyz">CBPS server</a> (PS Vita hacking group I’m a part of) at the address <a href="https://swindlesmccoop.cbps.xyz">swindlesmccoop.cbps.xyz</a> but a couple months later, after I was serious about it, I got my own domain, the one you see right now. Fun fact about that - I almost purchased my domain from Epik literally two days before Epik Fail happened - what a close call. Anyways, I wanted to just take a look at the evolution of this website, which thankfully the Web Archive automatically has taken snapshots of around the times that I have drastically changed it.</p>
<p>All images are clickable and lead to an archived version of the site, allowing you to look through it in your browser by yourself.</p>
<h2 id="july-27-2021---the-very-first-design">July 27, 2021 - The Very First Design</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210727193506/https://swindlesmccoop.cbps.xyz/"><img src="/images/website-1.png" width="1050" alt="image" /></a> I originally designed the site as a place for people who played <em>Monster Hunter: Rise</em> with me to be able to learn more about me and contact me and whatnot.</p>
<h2 id="august-9-2021---independence">August 9, 2021 - Independence</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210809205624/http://swindlesmccoop.xyz/"><img src="/images/website-2.png" width="1050" alt="image" /></a> This is when I started to actually learn stuff about HTML. If you notice, I have the same wallpaper (I recently applied the static filter though) and I still have the <em>Powered by Navi</em> banner on my page, though it now links to LainChan. I started my blog at this point but I don’t think I actually ever even posted on it because it was kind of cumbersome when trying to make a post.</p>
<h2 id="november-28-2021---feedback">November 28, 2021 - Feedback</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128052813/https://swindlesmccoop.xyz/"><img src="/images/website-3.png" width="1050" alt="image" /></a> I started getting more traffic to the site and people started telling me more things to change. I got some new fonts, as well as added options to contact.</p>
<h2 id="february-16-2022---the-box">February 16, 2022 - The Box</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220216154117/https://swindlesmccoop.xyz/"><img src="/images/website-4.png" width="1050" alt="image" /></a> I wanted to have everything in a box at the center, which you could see that I did. Also, I had first started learning about Uncle Ted, so I had a link to his books. I accidentally made the font too large on that link for a brief moment, and I guess that was the exact moment that the Web Archive had archived it.</p>
<p>I also set up these nice dropdown boxes at the top that I had set up until literally yesterday as of writing this.</p>
<h2 id="april-18-2022---rss-feeds">April 18, 2022 - RSS Feeds</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220418003525/https://swindlesmccoop.xyz/"><img src="/images/website-5.png" width="1050" alt="image" /></a> I guess this was around the time I wrote my own blogging script, because the RSS feeds are there now. I wrote a script to make an RSS feed from a Gitea user’s commits, which I had active for a while, but Gitea ended up implementing their own solution, and I don’t even use Gitea anymore, I use Github. The RSS feed for the blog was managed by my script, which I was pretty proud of. Like I showed in <a href="/blog/blogtex.html">my last post</a>, I write my blog using LaTeX and a different program I wrote called <a href="https://github.com/swindlesmccoop/BlOgTeX">BlOgTeX</a>, but if you want to look at that old script, it’s <a href="https://github.com/swindlesmccoop/not-just-dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/blogpost">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="november-27-2022---the-modern-design">November 27, 2022 - The Modern Design</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221127183815/https://swindlesmccoop.xyz/"><img src="/images/website-6.png" width="1050" alt="image" /></a> This is what the website looked like until about a couple weeks ago as of writing this. I had wanted to overhaul the entire thing for a while, but only recently did I have the motivation and the know-how to actually do so. I have the banners on the page now in their own little box.</p>
<h2 id="frebruary-27-2023---server-migration">Frebruary 27, 2023 - Server Migration</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230227003835/https://swindlesmccoop.xyz/"><img src="/images/website-7.png" width="1050" alt="image" /></a> The Web Archive happened to capture my website while I was migrating servers. Not relevant, just thought it was kind of funny.</p>
<h2 id="may-23-2023---today">May 23, 2023 - Today</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230524145951/https://swindlesmccoop.xyz/"><img src="/images/website-8.png" width="1050" alt="image" /></a> And here we are today. I’m so happy to run my own website, honestly. I think my favorite part is that I can just do whatever I want on it without any limitations (besides storage space). I want to do more in the future, like maybe run a radio station, but that is for future endeavors. My domain expires in a couple months and my server in about half of a year, so we’ll see how things go in the future.</p>
