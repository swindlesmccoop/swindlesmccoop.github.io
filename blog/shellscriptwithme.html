<p>I <em>love</em> shell scripting, so much so that I want to share my love for it with the world. Though I havenâ€™t really been gaining subscribers on my channel, my videos are getting what I call a decent amount of views. My i3 video got 40 views, which in my opinion is pretty good. Though looking at the analytics is a bit discouraging (most people only watched about 10% of the video, which was around 3 minutes), it proves that I can make at least somewhat attractive videos. Videos that make seemingly complex things very simple have always been something I thought were cool, so if I made a video series about the basics of shell scripting, helpful coreutils, stream manipulations, network interaction, CLI programs, status bar scripts, and general tools to make life easier, I think it could actually be very successful and give me at least a bit more of an audience than what I currently have.</p>
<p>I think I would make the videos in parts like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part 1: Standard Input and Output</p></li>
<li><p>Part 2: Helpful Standard Core Utilities</p></li>
<li><p>Part 3: Manipulating Text and Variables</p></li>
<li><p>Part 4: Networking With cURL</p></li>
<li><p>Part 5: Writing a CLI program</p></li>
<li><p>Part 6: Writing Status Bar Scripts</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This could be really fun and informative for a lot of people.</p>
