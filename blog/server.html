<p>I almost just lost it all on accident.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Njalla as my server and domain provider for a while now. Domain-wise, there really isn’t much better that I can really register with without giving out all of my personal information. Server-wise, I could be doing a lot better. Not only are their policies, let’s just say <a href="https://crippled.media/free-speech-vps-providers-put-to-the-test">interesting</a> (scroll to Njalla section), but they’re pretty expensive in return for not much benefit.</p>
<p>However, I decided to check my email today since I hadn’t in a long time, and I realized my server is expiring literally tomorrow. Gonna zip it all up into a tarball so I can move it straight over to my new server when I get one.</p>
<p>Based on that list that I linked previously, I’m considering the following providers at the moment (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Kyun</p></li>
<li><p>BuyVM/Frantech</p></li>
<li><p>Privex</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of them are mostly in my price range, it’s mostly about getting the actual Monero to pay for what I want, which will take me some time. This website will be going down for a hot minute probably while I figure out what provider I’m gonna use and how I’m going to pay since I don’t really hold any cryptocurrency at all. I’ll see about throwing all the static contents up on like a Github site or something and mirroring it to this domain so hopefully we aren’t down for too long.</p>
<p>Also, a couple of those providers also allow you to anonymously purchase a domain from them as well, so that could be something worth checking out if you’re in the same boat as me.</p>
