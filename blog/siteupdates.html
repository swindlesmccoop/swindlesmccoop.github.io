<p>I got a new VPS, so I’m able to do more with my site than just host static HTML pages. I want to do more, but I don’t yet know what exactly. I want to host something like <a href="https://github.com/PiJoules/atchannel">@channel</a>, the imageboard from Steins;Gate, however I fear that it will attract unsavory people that will upload gore, pornography, and cheese pizza. Now onto the more concrete plans that I have.</p>
<p>First, I’m going to change my blog to be easier to manage. I have a <a href="https://github.com/swindlesmccoop/not-just-dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/blogpost">script</a> to handle it currently, but it’s poorly-written (I haven’t updated it for over nine months now), and it’s a bit of an artifact of what I’m going to call the legacy site. I’m most likely going to overhaul the entire site’s design and make it, well, good. I will not maintain the legacy site, <em><strong>HOWEVER</strong></em> I will keep it up. It holds a lot of sentimental value to me. I haven’t changed anything about the site since I first made it in the summer of 2021, only expanded on what I already have. But it’s shoddily held together and I want an efficient system that allows me to easily manage everything.</p>
<p>I don’t yet know if I will go through with these changes yet. Like I said, this site is something that I care about a lot, and to change it all will probably be a bit overwhelming. This site is very me, if you can understand that. But I’m reaching nearly 1,000 subscribers on my YouTube channel, and I want something neat and presentable. I’m a bit torn between having something that accurately represents my computing philosophy ("Get it done by any means possible, as efficiently as possible, as minimal as possible.") and something that looks somewhat professional. The former appeals to the "in" crowd. The /g/ browsers. The ricers. The latter appeals to the people that have well-paying jobs in the tech industry, that don’t live in their mothers’ basements - but they are the same type of people that love JavaScript and Rust.</p>
<p>I think the best thing to do would be to find a balance in between both of these things. Something that is well put-together, so not hacky like the current solution, but something that feels at-home with me. Or maybe I should just make a website like <a href="https://icum.to">this</a> and call it a day.</p>
